				Hi how are you doing? I'm doing fine, how about yourself? Why I'm doing quite well myself, thank you for asking. Well how are the kids? Still as invisible as ever. Oh that's correct, you don't have any.<br> Yes, they are about as real as you. That is to say that you're not. </br> I'm just typing to fill up space so I can see what a paragraph looks like and making up some conversation seemed like the easiest choice, and it's starting to prove me right.</p>

				Hi, <b>how</b> are you doing? I'm doing <strong>fine</strong>, how  about <i>yourself</i>? Why I'm doing quite well myself, thank you for asking. Well how are the kids? Still as invisible as ever. Oh that's correct, you don't have any. <em>Yes</em>, they are about as real as you. That is to say that you're not. I'm just typing to fill up space so I can see what a paragraph looks like and making up some conversation seemed like the easiest choice, and it's starting to prove me right.</p>
